    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Begin by heating up oil in a roomy, sturdy skillet to around 350°F (175°C). Fry up pieces of corn tortilla and diced onion in the hot oil until they turn crispy and acquire a beautiful golden-brown hue. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking. Once done, carefully transfer them onto a plate lined with paper towels to allow excess oil to drain. Empty the skillet, leaving only a faint trace of oil behind.</li>
        <li>Next, place the skillet over medium heat. Gently return the fried tortillas and onion to the skillet. Mix in gently beaten eggs, and season with a pinch of salt for flavor. Continue to cook and stir until the eggs set and form a delightful texture.</li>
        <li>Gradually introduce tomato sauce and water into the mixture, stirring skillfully to combine all the elements. Lower the heat to a gentle simmer and allow it to thicken naturally for approximately 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>As the final touch, sprinkle a layer of shredded cheese over the concoction. Continue cooking until the cheese melts gloriously, blanketing the dish with its gooey goodness.</li>  
    </ol>
